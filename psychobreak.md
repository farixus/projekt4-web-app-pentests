## Executive Summary

## List of Findings
### Task1
#### Title \#1
FTP
#### Description (reproduction steps)
In my scan I found opened port 21 (ftp). All transmited data through this port are send in plain text. When attacker obtain access to transmited data i.e. in method MIDM (Man-In-The-Middle) can easy uncover sensitive data.
#### Recommendations
Turn off ftp service at all and use other method. SFTP (SSH FTP), SCP (Secure Copy), etc.
#### Title \#2
Banner Grabbing
#### Description (reproduction steps)
Port Scanning shows that attacker can easy uncover types and versions of applications installed on the system and system itself, gather this information and then use if to prepare relevant manner of attack.
#### Recommendations
If not really necessery turn off displaying names and versions of installed application or change it a bit.

## Walkthrough
### Web
As we can read at the beginning this room was based on a video game called evil within. So try this out!
Deploy the machine and start Reconnaissance.

`Write ip address of machine to /etc/hosts to use friendly name instead of ip address`

Add line to /etc/hosts
```
10.10.227.164   psychobreak.sda
```

Start to scan:

```
sudo nmap -sSCV -T4 -A -oA nmap_scan psychobreak.sda

```
As a result of above commend we get opened ports with banner info and operating system name.
```
21/tcp open  ftp     ProFTPD 1.3.5a
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
